barangays as the smallest administrative division, responsible for managing small neighborhoods. Many barangays still rely on manual, paper-based methods in managing resident records, certificates, and official transactions. Sometimes people will also grow frustrated when they visit the Barangay hall for something important, and the Barangay captain is either busy or not on site.
